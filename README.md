- Keras/TensorFlow 
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision

## :slightly_smiling_face: Motivation
Covid is the most serious issue all over the world. Major spread is based due to careless human behaviour. Covid cases can be taken into control with help of social distancing and face mask and sanitization.
Among  this there is no efficient face mask detection application, with available data resources.

## :file_folder: Dataset

The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:

This dataset consists of 3835 images belonging to two classes:
- with_mask: 1916 images :mask:
- without_mask: 1919 images. :sneezing_face:
