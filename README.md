# Mask Detecion system built with Computer Vision concepts in order to detect masks in real-time. 
Mask Detection for Safe Life.

Use:
- OpenCV [Haar Cascade]
- Keras/TensorFlow 
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision

## Motivation
Covid is the most serious issue all over the world. Major spread is based due to careless human behaviour. Covid cases can be taken into control with help of social distancing and face mask and sanitization.
Among  this there is no efficient face mask detection application, with available data resources.
